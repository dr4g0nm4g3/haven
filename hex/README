 HEX alpha exokernel version 0.0.x

========================================================
About
========================================================
The HEX alpha kernel is a precursor to the HEX exokernel.
This kernel's purpose is to experiment with kernel development
to determine what are the best practices and what is required
of the kernel to fulfill it's goal.

========================================================
Directory Structure
========================================================
Following the style of the linux kernel source, generic kernel
and architecture specific code will be split into separate
directories to allow for modularilty in compilation
and for easy understanding of the source's function and purpose.
The generic high-level directory structure is:

+ <Root Dir>
|----+ arch					(contains architecture specific code)
	 |----+ i386			(contains intel i386+ specific code)
	 	  |----+ boot		(contains the boot loader code for intel 386+ srchitectures)
		  |----+ include	(contains headers for intel specific 386+ architectures)
		  |----+ kernel		(contains kernel code specific to the i386+ architecture)
|----+ include				(contains headers for the kernel)
|----+ kernel				(contains kernel code independent of the architecture)


***this directory structure will change overtime as the kernel is developed

========================================================
Building
========================================================
To build the project, run the following:

make clean
make [arch]

where [arch] is the architecture to build the kernel on. 

Valid values for [arch] are:

i386
